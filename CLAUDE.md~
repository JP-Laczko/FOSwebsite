i've got some stuff that can help fix your issue:

first here is the data in mongo the backend:



schedule
Object

Thursday
Object

Friday
Object

Saturday
Object

Tuesday
Object

Monday
Object

as you can see there is no entry for wednesday and sunday.

the data from this code:
for (let dayIndex = 0; dayIndex < 7; dayIndex++) {
          const date = new Date(baseDate);
          date.setDate(baseDate.getDate() + ((dayIndex - baseDate.getDay() + 7) % 7));
          
          const dateStr = date.toISOString().split("T")[0];
          const weekdayName = date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
          
          const entry = availabilityMap[dayIndex];
          console.log(entry);
          
          if (!entry) {
            // Day missing from data - show red "No availability"
            events.push({ 
              title: "No availability", 
              start: dateStr, 
              allDay: true,
              backgroundColor: '#f44336',
              borderColor: '#f44336',
              textColor: '#fff',
              extendedProps: {
                type: 'no-availability'
              }
            });

the entry returns this from the log:
ObjectdayIndex: 0end: -1start: -1[[Prototype]]: Object

coach.js:195 ObjectdayIndex: 2end: -1start: -1[[Prototype]]: Object

coach.js:195 ObjectdayIndex: 5end: -1start: -1[[Prototype]]: Object
coach.js:195 ObjectdayIndex: 6end: 22start: 15[[Prototype]]: Object
as you can see it seems to default to -1 -1 which may be where the issue is coming from. can you figure out why, i bet this will fix many of the other issues on the modal.
