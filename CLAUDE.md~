i was getting this error and am not sure why. i changed this line: const update = remove
      ? { $unset: { [`schedule.${day}`]: "" } }
      : { $set: { [`schedule.${day}`]: { start, end } } };

because it is supposed to be unset to remove the day iteself - it was not working before. Can you fix this, is that why the error is caused?
