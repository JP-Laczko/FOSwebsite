Is there a better way to view the calendar in the player cards on mobile. Right now that seems to be the only issue for users. Is there any way you could possibly fix this. Also is there a similar fix you could do for mobile on the calendar system on the coach page? On a phone, when you tap on things it zooms in for you and sometimes the users don't know you can zoom out.
